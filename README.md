# 🚀 OpenFast-RAG

**OpenFast-RAG** is a high-performance, lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine. It bridges the gap between your private documents and OpenAI’s reasoning capabilities using a modern FastAPI interface, persistent local storage, and a **real-time interactive dashboard.**

### ✨ Key Features

* **Interactive Chat Dashboard**: A modern, front-end interface built with **Jinja2 templates** allowing for seamless document interaction without leaving the browser.
* **Real-Time SSE Streaming**: Leverages **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to stream RAG responses token-by-token, providing a snappy, "ChatGPT-like" user experience.
* **Persistent Knowledge Base**: Uses a local **SQLite** database to remember your Vector Store ID across server restarts or Docker rebuilds.
* **Instant Document Indexing**: Upload PDFs, TXT, or Docx files directly. The system handles secure transmission to OpenAI's managed infrastructure and provides immediate indexing feedback.
* **Admin Control Center**: Dedicated endpoints to monitor indexed files, view all account-wide vector stores, and perform targeted deletions.
* **Context-Aware Reasoning**: Uses the latest **OpenAI Responses API** with `file_search` for grounded, accurate answers based strictly on your uploaded data.

### 🛠️ Functionality Overview

#### 1. Real-Time Streaming (`/chat/stream`)

Unlike standard request-response loops, the streaming endpoint uses asynchronous generators to push data chunks to the UI as they are generated by OpenAI.

#### 2. Chat Interface (`/`)

A fully responsive dashboard that integrates document uploading and conversational AI in one view. It features auto-scrolling chat bubbles and processing states.

#### 3. Admin Control Panel (`/admin`)

* **Status**: Deep-dive into active store details and account-wide storage overview.
* **Targeted Deletion**: Remove specific Vector Stores by ID or delete individual files within a store.
* **System Reset**: A clean-slate option to wipe the active store and reset the local SQLite database.

Add your API key to a `.env` file in the root:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxx...

```


2. **Launch with Docker**:
```bash
docker-compose up --build

```


3. **Access the Dashboard**:
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` for the Chat UI or `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the Swagger API documentation.
